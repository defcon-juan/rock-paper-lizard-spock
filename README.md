rock paper scissors lizard spock terminal game

started with the real python tutorial then added extra logic for:

1. Capitalising spocks name every time

2. Keeping track of wins, losses, draws and win rate

3. Added scores print out at the end of the game for user

4. Used OS import pause to allow user to view scores without terminal window closing
